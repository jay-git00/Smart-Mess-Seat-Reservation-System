# Smart-Mess-Seat-Reservation-System
∗ Built an initial Arduino based prototype using physical buttons for seat toggling and serial display of occupancy
status.

∗ Upgraded the design to an ESP32 based featuring Wi-Fi connectivity and rollnumber based seat booking, and a
responsive web dashboard for live tracking.

∗ Gained practical exposure to microcontrollers such as STM32, Arduino and ESP32 with a strong understanding
of embedded hardware design and interfacing.
